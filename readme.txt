Cross-Post from your WordPress.com blog to your self-hosted WordPress website

== Description ==

WP.com Cross-Post is a free plugin that syncs your WordPress.com blog with your self-hosted WordPress site automatically, every day.

It creates posts on your self-hosted WordPress site by fetching them from WordPress.com through the API and publishes them automatically.

**Cron Jobs in your self-hosted WordPress site must be enabled.**

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of this plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WordPress.com Cross-Post" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
